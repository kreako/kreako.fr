It tracks changes in sensitive data and the integrity of the history will be protected by the clients, without the need to trust the server. It can operate as a key-value store or as relational database (SQL).\n\nTraditional database transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable, so there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised. immudb is immutable. You can add new versions of existing records, but never change or delete records. This lets you store critical data without fear of it being tampered.\n\nData stored in immudb is cryptographically coherent and verifiable, just like with blockchains, but without all the complexity. Unlike blockchains, immudb can handle millions of transactions per second, and can be used both as a lightweight service or embedded in your application as a library. immudb runs everywhere, on an IoT device, your notebook, a server, on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nimmudb is already used by hundreds of projects to store tamper-proof data and to keep the data change history immutable. immudb can be used as a key-value store or relational data structure and supports both transactions and blobs, so there are no limits to the use cases.\n\nCompanies use immudb to secure and tamper-evident log data, sensor data, sensitive data, transactions, software build recipes, rule-base data, even artifacts or even video streams.",

(Otherwise MacOS Safari and IE won't recognize the favicon.)\n\nThat's all! :-)",

While ultimately the goal is to be a general purpose hand tracking engine supporting any hand pose, the engine evolves around specific hand poses that users/developers find useful. These poses are detected by the engine which allows to build applications with meaningful interactions. See the demo for an example.",

It can operate as a key-value store or as relational database (SQL).\n\nTraditional database transactions and logs are hard to scale and are mutable, so there is no way to know for sure if your data has been compromised. immudb is immutable. You can add new versions of existing records, but never change or delete records. This lets you store critical data without fear of it being tampered.\n\nData stored in immudb is cryptographically coherent and verifiable, just like with blockchains, but without all the complexity. Unlike blockchains, immudb can handle millions of transactions per second, and can be used both as a lightweight service or embedded in your application as a library. immudb runs everywhere, on an IoT device, your notebook, a server, on-premise or in the cloud.\n\nimmudb is already used by hundreds of projects to store tamper-proof data and to keep the data change history immutable. immudb can be used as a key-value store or relational data structure and supports both transactions and blobs, so there are no limits to the use cases.\n\nCompanies use immudb to secure and tamper-evident log data, sensor data, sensitive data, transactions, software build recipes, rule-base data, even artifacts or even video streams.",
